I am Yanxuan Wu (吴焱煊). I got a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, with a minor in Finance, from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2023. After that, I worked as a data scientist at [Moseeker](https://www.moseeker.com/en/) (an AI-powered Human Resource technology firm), focusing on AI tools development and data analysis. In parallel, I have been working as a research assistant for [Prof.Xitong Li](https://sites.google.com/view/xitong-li/home) (HEC, Paris) and [Prof.Shunyuan Zhang](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1175206) (Harvard Business School).
