I am Yanxuan Wu (吴焱煊). I got a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, with a minor in Finance, from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2023. After that, I worked as a Tutor at [NewChannel](https://www.xhd.cn/topic/about/index.html), focusing on 1v1 [IELTS](https://ielts.org/) Teaching. In parallel, I have been working on research project with [Prof.Shunyuan Zhang](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1175206) (Harvard Business School).
